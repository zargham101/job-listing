##  Project Overview

This is a full-stack **Job Listing Application** that allows you to scrape actuarial jobs from [actuarylist.com](https://www.actuarylist.com), store them in a PostgreSQL database, and manage them through a responsive React frontend.

---

##  Features

###  Backend (Flask + SQLAlchemy)

- REST API Endpoints:
  - `GET /jobs` â€” List all jobs (with filters and sorting)
  - `GET /jobs/<id>` â€” Get a specific job
  - `POST /jobs` â€” Add new job
  - `PUT /jobs/<id>` â€” Update existing job
  - `DELETE /jobs/<id>` â€” Delete a job

- Supports filtering and sorting by:
  - Job type
  - Location
  - Tags
  - Posting date

- Error handling with 400/404 responses
- CORS enabled for frontend integration

---

###  Scraper (Selenium + Edge WebDriver)

- Uses XPath to find job cards
- Scrolls page dynamically to load all jobs
- Extracts:
  - Title
  - Company
  - Location
  - Tags
  - Posting date
  - Job type
  - Application link

- Adds new jobs directly to the database
- Avoids duplicates

---

###  Frontend (React + MUI + CSS Modules)

- Fully responsive for **mobile â†’ 4K screens**
- Job cards display:
  - Title, Company, Location
  - Type, Tags, Posting Date

- CRUD Functionalities:
  -  Add Job (shown only on button click)
  -  Edit Job (form pre-filled)
  -  Delete Job (with confirmation)
  -  View details in modal

- Filtering & Sorting:
  - Search by keyword
  - Filter by job type, location, tag
  - Sort by newest or oldest

- Built with **Material UI (MUI)** for modern UI experience
